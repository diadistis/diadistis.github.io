<h2><a name="Quick_start_guide"></a>Quick start guide</h2>
    
<p>
      This document is a short introduction into the basic use cases of
      <i>Commons Configuration</i> for the impatient. Later chapters of this
      user's guide explain the concepts presented here in more detail.
    </p>

    <section>
<h3><a name="Reading_a_properties_file"></a>Reading a properties file</h3>
    
<p>
      Configuration information is frequently stored in properties files.
      Consider the following simple file that defines some properties related
      to accessing a database. We assume that it is stored as
      <code>database.properties</code> in the local file system:
    </p>
    
<div class="source">
<pre>database.host = db.acme.com
database.port = 8199
database.user = admin
database.password = ???
database.timeout = 60000
</pre></div>
    
<p>
      The easiest way to read this file is via the
      <code><a >
      Configurations</a></code> helper class. This class offers a bunch of
      convenience methods for creating configuration objects from different
      sources. For reading a properties file the code looks as follows:
    </p>
    
<div class="source">
<pre>Configurations configs = new Configurations();
try
{
    Configuration config = configs.properties(new File("config.properties"));
    // access configuration properties
    ...
}
catch (ConfigurationException cex)
{
    // Something went wrong
}
</pre></div>
    </section>

    <section>
<h3><a name="Accessing_properties"></a>Accessing properties</h3>
    
<p>
      The <code><a >
      Configuration</a></code> object obtained in the last step can now be used
      to query the values for the stored configuration properties. For this
      purpose, numerous get methods for different property types are available.
      For the properties contained in the example file the following methods
      can be used:
    </p>
    
<div class="source">
<pre>String dbHost = config.getString("database.host");
int dbPort = config.getInt("database.port");
String dbUser = config.getString("database.user");
String dbPassword = config.getString("database.password", "secret");  // provide a default
long dbTimeout = config.getLong("database.timeout");
</pre></div>
    
<p>
      Note that the keys passed to the get methods match the keys contained in
      the properties file. If a key cannot be resolved, the default behavior of
      a configuration is to return <b>null</b>. (Methods that return
      a primitive type throw an exception because in this case there is no
      <b>null</b> value.) It is possible to provide a default value
      which is used when the key cannot be found.
    </p>
    </section>

    <section>
<h3><a name="Reading_an_XML_file"></a>Reading an XML file</h3>
    
<p>
      XML is also a suitable format for storing configuration information,
      especially if the data becomes more complex. For instance, lists of
      values can be stored in a natural way by just repeating tags. The
      example file for this section defines some directory paths that are to be
      processed by an application. It is named <code>paths.xml</code> and looks
      as follows:
    </p>
    
<div class="source">
<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?&gt;
&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;processing stage="qa"&gt;
    &lt;paths&gt;
      &lt;path&gt;/data/path1&lt;/path&gt;
      &lt;path&gt;/data/otherpath&lt;/path&gt;
      &lt;path&gt;/var/log&lt;/path&gt;
    &lt;/paths&gt;
  &lt;/processing&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre></div>
    
<p>
      Reading this file works analogously to reading a properties file. Again a
      <code><a >
      Configurations</a></code> instance is needed (by the way, this class is
      thread-safe, and an instance can be shared and reused to read multiple
      configuration sources), but this time we use the <code>xml()</code>
      method rather than <code>properties()</code>:
    </p>
    
<div class="source">
<pre>Configurations configs = new Configurations();
try
{
    XMLConfiguration config = configs.xml("paths.xml");
    // access configuration properties
    ...
}
catch (ConfigurationException cex)
{
    // Something went wrong
}
</pre></div>
    
<p>
      The <code>xml()</code> method returns an object of type
      <code><a >
      XMLConfiguration</a></code>. This class implements the
      <code>Configuration</code> interface, but offers some more functionality
      to access properties in a more structured manner. The reader may also have
      noticed that we passed a string to <code>xml()</code> while we used a
      <code>java.io.File</code> object in the properties example. All these
      methods come in several overloaded variants allowing the caller to specify
      the configuration source in different ways: as a file, as a URL, or as a
      string. In the latter case, the file is searched for in various places,
      including at an absolute file path, at a relative file path, as a resource
      in the classpath, or in the current user's home directory.
    </p>

<h3><a name="Accessing_properties_from_XML"></a>Accessing properties from XML</h3>
    
<p>
      Accessing properties in a XML configuration (or any other hierarchical
      configuration) supports the same query methods as for regular
      configurations. There are some additional facilities that take the
      hierarchical nature of these sources into account. The properties in the
      example configuration can be read in the following way:
    </p>
    
<div class="source">
<pre>String stage = config.getString("processing[@stage]");
List&lt;String&gt; paths = config.getList(String.class, "processing.paths.path");
</pre></div>
    
<p>
      The keys for properties are generated by concatenating the possibly nested
      tag names in the XML document (ignoring the root element). For attributes,
      there is a special syntax as shown for the <i>stage</i> property.
      Because the <i>path</i> element appears multiple times it actually
      defines a list. With the <code>getList()</code> method all values can be
      queried at once.
    </p>
    
<p>
      Hierarchical configurations support an advanced syntax for keys that
      allows a navigation to a specific element in the source document. This is
      achieved by adding numeric indices in parentheses after the single key parts. For
      instance, in order to reference the second <i>path</i> element in the
      list, the following key can be used (indices are 0-based):
    </p>
    
<div class="source">
<pre>String secondPath = config.getString("processing.paths.path(1)");
</pre></div>
    
<p>
      For elements which are not repeated such indices can be dropped. It is
      also possible to set an alternative <i>expression engine</i> - the
      component that evaluates and interprets configuration keys. There is an
      implementation available which can deal with XPath expressions. Refer to
      <a href="howto_hierarchical.html#Expression_engines">Expression engines</a>
      for further details.
    </p>

<h3><a name="Updating_a_configuration"></a>Updating a configuration</h3>
    
<p>
      The <code>Configuration</code> interface defines some methods for
      manipulating configuration properties. Typical CRUD operations are
      available for all properties. The following code fragment shows how the
      example properties configuration can be changed. The port of the database
      is changed to a new value, and a new property is added:
    </p>

<div class="source">
<pre>config.setProperty("database.port", 8200);
config.addProperty("database.type", "production");
</pre></div>
    
<p>
      <code>addProperty()</code> always adds a new value to the configuration.
      If the affected key already exists, the value is added to this key, so
      that it becomes a list. <code>setProperty()</code> in contrast overrides
      an existing value (or creates a new one if the key does not exist). Both
      methods can be passed an arbitrary value object. This can also be an
      array or a collection, which makes it possible to add multiple values in a
      single step.
    </p>
    </section>

    <section>
<h3><a name="Saving_a_configuration"></a>Saving a configuration</h3>
    
<p>
      After a configuration has been manipulated, it should probably be saved
      again to make the changes persistent. Otherwise, the changes are only in
      memory. If configurations are to be changed, it is preferable to obtain
      them via a different mechanism: a <i>configuration builder</i>.
      Builders are the most powerful and flexible way to construct
      configurations. They support many settings that impact the way the
      configuration data is loaded and the resulting configuration object
      behaves. Builders for file-based configurations also offer a
      <code>save()</code> method that writes all configuration data back to
      disk. Configuration builders are typically created using a fluent API
      which allows a convenient and flexible configuration of the builder. This
      API is described in the section
      <a href="howto_builders.html#Configuration_Builders">Configuration
      builders</a>. For simple use cases, the
      <code><a >
      Configurations</a></code> class we have already used has again some convenience
      methods. The following code fragment shows how a configuration is read via
      a builder, manipulated, and finally saved again:
    </p>

<div class="source">
<pre>Configurations configs = new Configurations();
try
{
    // obtain the configuration
    FileBasedConfigurationBuilder&lt;XMLConfiguration&gt; builder = configs.xmlBuilder("paths.xml");
    XMLConfiguration config = builder.getConfiguration();

    // update property
    config.addProperty("newProperty", "newValue");

    // save configuration
    builder.save();
}
catch (ConfigurationException cex)
{
    // Something went wrong
}
