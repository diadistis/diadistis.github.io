<h2><a name="Hierarchical_Configurations"></a>Hierarchical Configurations</h2>
    
<p>
      Many sources of configuration data have a hierarchical or tree-like
      nature. They can represent data that is structured in many ways.
      Such configuration sources are represented by classes implementing the
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/HierarchicalConfiguration.html">
      HierarchicalConfiguration</a></code> interface. With
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/BaseHierarchicalConfiguration.html">
      BaseHierarchicalConfiguration</a></code> there is a fully functional
      implementation of the interface from which most of the hierarchical
      configuration classes shipped with <i>Commons Configuration</i> are
      derived.
    </p>
    
<p>
      Prominent examples of hierarchical configuration sources are XML
      documents. They can be read and written using the
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/XMLConfiguration.html">
      XMLConfiguration</a></code> class. This section explains how
      to deal with such structured data and demonstrates the enhanced query
      facilities supported by <code>HierarchicalConfiguration</code>. We
      use XML documents as examples for structured configuration sources,
      but the information provided here (especially the rules for accessing
      properties) applies to other hierarchical configurations as well.
      Examples for other hierarchical configuration classes are

<h3><a name="Accessing_properties_in_hierarchical_configurations"></a>Accessing properties in hierarchical configurations</h3>
    
<p>
      We will start with a simple XML document to show some basics
      about accessing properties. The following file named
      <code>gui.xml</code> is used as example document:
    </p>

<div class="source">
<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?&gt;
&lt;gui-definition&gt;
  &lt;colors&gt;
    &lt;background&gt;#808080&lt;/background&gt;
    &lt;text&gt;#000000&lt;/text&gt;
    &lt;header&gt;#008000&lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;link normal="#000080" visited="#800080"/&gt;
    &lt;default&gt;${colors.header}&lt;/default&gt;
  &lt;/colors&gt;
  &lt;rowsPerPage&gt;15&lt;/rowsPerPage&gt;
  &lt;buttons&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;OK&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Cancel&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Help&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;/buttons&gt;
  &lt;numberFormat pattern="###,###.##"/&gt;
&lt;/gui-definition&gt;
</pre></div>
    
<p>
      (As becomes obvious, this tutorial does not bother with good
      design of XML documents, the example file should rather
      demonstrate the different ways of accessing properties.)
      To access the data stored in this document it must be loaded
      by <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/XMLConfiguration.html">
      XMLConfiguration</a></code>. Like for other
      <a href="howto_filebased.html">file-based</a>  configuration classes
      a <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/FileBasedConfigurationBuilder.html">
      FileBasedConfigurationBuilder</a></code> is used for reading the source
      file as shown in the following code fragment:
    </p>

<div class="source">
<pre>Parameters params = new Parameters();
FileBasedConfigurationBuilder&lt;XMLConfiguration&gt; builder =
    new FileBasedConfigurationBuilder&lt;XMLConfiguration&gt;(XMLConfiguration.class)
    .configure(params.xml()
        .setFileName("gui.xml"));
try
{
    XMLConfiguration config = builder.getConfiguration();
    ...
}
catch(ConfigurationException cex)
{
    // loading of the configuration file failed
}
</pre></div>
    
<p>
      If no exception was thrown, the properties defined in the
      XML document are now available in the configuration object.
      Other hierarchical configuration classes that operate on files can be
      loaded in an analogous way. The following fragment shows how the
      properties in the configuration object can be accessed:
    </p>

<div class="source">
<pre>String backColor = config.getString("colors.background");
String textColor = config.getString("colors.text");
String linkNormal = config.getString("colors.link[@normal]");
String defColor = config.getString("colors.default");
int rowsPerPage = config.getInt("rowsPerPage");
List&lt;Object&gt; buttons = config.getList("buttons.name");
</pre></div>
    
<p>
      This listing demonstrates some important points about constructing the
      keys for accessing properties in hierarchical configuration sources and about
      features of <code>HierarchicalConfiguration</code> in general:
      </p>
<ul>
        
<li>
          Nested elements are accessed using a dot notation. In
          the example document there is an element <code>&lt;text&gt;</code>
          in the body of the <code>&lt;color&gt;</code> element. The
          corresponding key is <code>color.text</code>.
        </li>
        
<li>
          The root element is ignored when constructing keys. In
          the example you do not write <code>gui-definition.color.text</code>,
          but only <code>color.text</code>.
        </li>
        
<li>
          Attributes of XML elements are accessed in a XPath like notation.
        </li>
        
<li>
          <a href="howto_basicfeatures.html#Variable_Interpolation">Interpolation</a>
          can be used in the same way as for all other standard configuration
          implementations. Here the <code>&lt;default&gt;</code> element in the
          <code>colors</code> section refers to another color.
        </li>
        
<li>
          Lists of properties can be defined by just repeating elements.
          In this example the <code>buttons.name</code> property
          has the three values <i>OK</i>, <i>Cancel</i>, and
          <i>Help</i>, so it is queried using the <code>getList()</code>
          method. This works with attributes, too. In addition, a special
          <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/convert/ListDelimiterHandler.html">
          ListDelimiterHandler</a></code> implementation can be set which
          supports splitting texts at a specific list delimiter character. This
          works in the same way as described in the section about
          <a href="howto_properties.html#Lists_and_arrays">properties
          configuration</a>. If this mode was used, the three button names could
          be defined in a single XML element. However, then the <i>pattern</i>
          attribute of the <code>&lt;numberFormat&gt;</code> element needs to
          escape the list delimiter which occurs in its content using a
          backslash character. With these changes the affected part of the XML
          document would look as follows:

<div class="source">
<pre>  &lt;buttons&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;OK, Cancel, Help&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;/buttons&gt;
  &lt;numberFormat pattern="###\,###.##"/&gt;
</pre></div>
          Because repeating elements is a natural pattern for XML documents
          using list splitting is rather untypical for this format.
        </li>
      </ul>
    
    
<p>
      The next section will show how data in a more complex XML
      document can be processed.

<h3><a name="Complex_hierarchical_structures"></a>Complex hierarchical structures</h3>
    
<p>
      Consider the following scenario: An application operates on
      database tables and wants to load a definition of the database
      schema from its configuration. A XML document provides this
      information. It could look as follows:
    </p>
    
<div class="source">
<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?&gt;

&lt;database&gt;
  &lt;tables&gt;
    &lt;table tableType="system"&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;users&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;fields&gt;
        &lt;field&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;uid&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;type&gt;long&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;/field&gt;
        &lt;field&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;uname&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;type&gt;java.lang.String&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;/field&gt;
        &lt;field&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;firstName&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;type&gt;java.lang.String&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;/field&gt;
        &lt;field&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;lastName&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;type&gt;java.lang.String&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;/field&gt;
        &lt;field&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;email&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;type&gt;java.lang.String&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;/field&gt;
      &lt;/fields&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;table tableType="application"&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;documents&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;fields&gt;
        &lt;field&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;docid&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;type&gt;long&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;/field&gt;
        &lt;field&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;name&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;type&gt;java.lang.String&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;/field&gt;
        &lt;field&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;creationDate&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;type&gt;java.util.Date&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;/field&gt;
        &lt;field&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;authorID&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;type&gt;long&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;/field&gt;
        &lt;field&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;version&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;type&gt;int&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;/field&gt;
      &lt;/fields&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/tables&gt;
&lt;/database&gt;
</pre></div>
    
<p>
      This XML is quite self explanatory; there is an arbitrary number
      of table elements, each of it has a name and a list of fields.
      A field in turn consists of a name and a data type. This
      XML document (let's call it <code>tables.xml</code>) can be
      loaded in exactly the same way as the simple document in the
      section before.
    </p>
    
<p>
      When we now want to access some of the properties we face a
      problem: the syntax for	constructing configuration keys we
      learned so far is not powerful enough to access all of the data
      stored in the tables document.
    </p>
    
<p>
      Because the document contains a list of tables some properties
      are defined more than once. E.g. the configuration key
      <code>tables.table.name</code> refers to a <code>name</code>
      element inside a <code>table</code> element inside a
      <code>tables</code> element. This constellation happens to
      occur twice in the tables document.
    </p>
    
<p>
      Multiple definitions of a property do not cause problems and are
      supported by all classes of Configuration. If such a property
      is queried using <code>getProperty()</code>, the method
      recognizes that there are multiple values for that property and
      returns a collection with all these values. So we could write
    </p>
    
<div class="source">
<pre>Object prop = config.getProperty("tables.table.name");
if(prop instanceof Collection)
{
	System.out.println("Number of tables: " + ((Collection&lt;?&gt;) prop).size());
}
</pre></div>
    
<p>
      An alternative to this code would be the <code>getList()</code>
      method of <code>Configuration</code>. If a property is known to
      have multiple values (as is the table name property in this example),
      <code>getList()</code> allows retrieving all values at once.
      <b>Note:</b> it is legal to call <code>getString()</code>
      or one of the other getter methods on a property with multiple
      values; it returns the first element of the list.
    </p>
    </section>

    <section>
<h3><a name="Accessing_structured_properties"></a>Accessing structured properties</h3>
    
<p>
      Okay, we can obtain a list with the names of all defined
      tables. In the same way we can retrieve a list with the names
      of all table fields: just pass the key
      <code>tables.table.fields.field.name</code> to the
      <code>getList()</code> method. In our example this list
      would contain 10 elements, the names of all fields of all tables.
      This is fine, but how do we know, which field belongs to
      which table?
    </p>
    
<p>
      When working with such hierarchical structures the configuration keys
      used to query properties can have an extended syntax. All components
      of a key can be appended by a numerical value in parentheses that
      determines the index of the affected property. So if we have two
      <code>table</code> elements we can exactly specify, which one we
      want to address by appending the corresponding index. This is
      explained best by some examples:
    </p>
    
<p>
      We will now provide some configuration keys and show the results
      of a <code>getProperty()</code> call with these keys as arguments.
      </p>
<dl>
      
<dt><code>tables.table(0).name</code></dt>
      
<dd>
        Returns the name of the first table (all indices are 0 based),
        in this example the string <i>users</i>.
      </dd>
      
<dt><code>tables.table(0)[@tableType]</code></dt>
      
<dd>
        Returns the value of the tableType attribute of the first
        table (<i>system</i>).
      </dd>
      
<dt><code>tables.table(1).name</code></dt>
      
<dd>
        Analogous to the first example returns the name of the
        second table (<i>documents</i>).
      </dd>
      
<dt><code>tables.table(2).name</code></dt>
      
<dd>
        Here the name of a third table is queried, but because there
        are only two tables result is <b>null</b>. The fact that a
        <b>null</b> value is returned for invalid indices can be used
        to find out how many values are defined for a certain property:
        just increment the index in a loop as long as valid objects
        are returned.
      </dd>
      
<dt><code>tables.table(1).fields.field.name</code></dt>
      
<dd>
        Returns a collection with the names of all fields that
        belong to the second table. With such kind of keys it is
        now possible to find out, which fields belong to which table.
      </dd>
      
<dt><code>tables.table(1).fields.field(2).name</code></dt>
      
<dd>
        The additional index after field selects a certain field.
        This expression represents the name of the third field in
        the second table (<i>creationDate</i>).
      </dd>
      
<dt><code>tables.table.fields.field(0).type</code></dt>
      
<dd>
        This key may be a bit unusual but nevertheless completely
        valid. It selects the data types of the first fields in all
        tables. So here a collection would be returned with the
        values [<i>long, long</i>].
      </dd>
      </dl>
    
    
<p>
      These examples should make the usage of indices quite clear.
      Because each configuration key can contain an arbitrary number
      of indices it is possible to navigate through complex structures of
      hierarchical configurations; each property can be uniquely identified.
    </p>
    </section>

    <section>
<h3><a name="Sub_Configurations"></a>Sub Configurations</h3>
    
<p>
      Sometimes dealing with long property keys may become inconvenient,
      especially if always the same properties are accessed. For this
      case <code>HierarchicalConfiguration</code> provides a short cut
      with the <code>configurationAt()</code> method. This method can
      be passed a key that selects exactly one node of the hierarchy
      of nodes contained in a hierarchical configuration. Then a new
      hierarchical configuration will be returned whose root node is
      the selected node. So all property keys passed into that
      configuration should be relative to the new root node. For
      instance, if we are only interested in information about the
      first database table, we could do something like that:
    </p>

<div class="source">
<pre>HierarchicalConfiguration&lt;ImmutableNode&gt; sub = config.configurationAt("tables.table(0)");
String tableName = sub.getString("name");  // only need to provide relative path
List&lt;Object&gt; fieldNames = sub.getList("fields.field.name");
</pre></div>
    
<p>
      For dealing with complex list-like structures there is another
      short cut. Often it will be necessary to iterate over all items
      in the list and access their (sub) properties. A good example are
      the fields of the tables in our demo configuration. When you want
      to process all fields of a table (e.g. for constructing a
      <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statement), you will need all information
      stored for them in the configuration. An option would be to use
      the <code>getList()</code> method to fetch the required data one
      by one:
    </p>

<div class="source">
<pre>List&lt;Object&gt; fieldNames = config.getList("tables.table(0).fields.field.name");
List&lt;Object&gt; fieldTypes = config.getList("tables.table(0).fields.field.type");
List&lt;Object&gt; ... // further calls for other data that might be stored in the config
</pre></div>
    
<p>
      But this is not very readable and will fail if not all field
      elements contain the same set of data (for instance the
      <code>type</code> property may be optional, then the list for
      the types can contain less elements than the other lists). A
      solution to these problems is the <code>configurationsAt()</code>
      method, a close relative to the <code>configurationAt()</code>
      method covered above. This method evaluates the passed in key and
      collects all configuration nodes that match this criterion. Then
      for each node a <code>HierarchicalConfiguration</code> object is
      created with this node as root node. A list with these configuration
      objects is returned. As the following example shows this comes in
      very handy when processing list-like structures:
    </p>

<div class="source">
<pre>List&lt;HierarchicalConfiguration&lt;ImmutableNode&gt;&gt; fields =
    config.configurationsAt("tables.table(0).fields.field");
for(HierarchicalConfiguration sub : fields)
{
    // sub contains all data about a single field
    String fieldName = sub.getString("name");
    String fieldType = sub.getString("type");
    ...
</pre></div>
    
<p>
      Per default, the configurations returned by the <code>configurationAt()</code> and
      <code>configurationsAt()</code> methods are a kind of snapshots of
      the data stored in the original configuration. If the original
      configuration is later changed, these changes are not visible in the
      sub configuration and vice versa. If configuration settings just need
      to be read, this is fine.
    </p>
    
<p>
      It is also possible to connect a sub configuration more directly to
      its original configuration. This is done by using overloaded versions
      of <code>configurationAt()</code> and <code>configurationsAt()</code>
      which accept an additional <b>boolean</b> parameter. If
      here the value <b>true</b> is passed, a special
      configuration implementation is returned (in fact, an instance of the
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/SubnodeConfiguration.html">
      SubnodeConfiguration</a></code> class) that operates on the same
      data structures as the original configuration. Therefore, changes made
      on one configuration are directly reflected by the other one.
    </p>
    
<p>
      Connecting a sub configuration with its parent configuration in the
      described way is useful in use cases in which configurations are
      updated. However, there can be pretty drastic updates which break
      such a connection. As an example, consider the case that a sub
      configuration is created for a certain sub tree of an original
      configuration. Now this sub tree gets removed from the original
      configuration. In this case, the sub configuration becomes detached
      from its parent. Its content is not changed, but it is now again like
      a snapshot or a copy of the original. This is demonstrated again in
      the following example:
</p>
<div class="source">
<pre>// sub points to the 2nd table
HierarchicalConfiguration&lt;ImmutableNode&gt; sub = config.configurationAt("tables.table(1)", true);
assertEquals("documents", sub.getString("name"));

// Now change name in parent configuration =&gt; should be visible in sub config
config.setProperty("tables.table(1).name", "tasks");
assertEquals("tasks", sub.getString("name"));

// Clear the whole content of the 2nd table
config.clearTree("tables.table(1)");
// The key used to create the sub configuration is no longer valid,
// so it is now detacted; it contains the recent data.
assertEquals("tasks", sub.getString("name"));
</pre></div>
    
    
<p>
      This example uses the <code>clearTree()</code> method of
      <code>HierarchicalConfiguration</code> to remove all information
      about the second database table from the configuration data. While
      <code>clearProperty()</code> only removes the value of a property,
      <code>clearTree()</code> also removes all child elements and their
      children recursively. After this operation the key
      <i>tables.table(1)</i> specified when the sub configuration was
      created no longer points to an existing element; therefore, the
      sub configuration gets detached. Once detached, a sub configuration
      cannot be reconnected to its parent again. Even if another table
      element was added (making the sub key valid again), the sub
      configuration remains detached.

<h3><a name="Adding_new_properties"></a>Adding new properties</h3>
    
<p>
      So far we have learned how to use indices to avoid ambiguities when
      querying properties. The same problem occurs when adding new
      properties to a structured configuration. As an example let's
      assume we want to add a new field to the second table. New properties
      can be added to a configuration using the <code>addProperty()</code>
      method. Of course, we have to exactly specify where in the tree like structure new
      data is to be inserted. A statement like
    </p>
    
<div class="source">
<pre>// Warning: This might cause trouble!
config.addProperty("tables.table.fields.field.name", "size");
</pre></div>
    
<p>
      would not be sufficient because it does not contain all needed
      information. How is such a statement processed by the
      <code>addProperty()</code> method?
    </p>
    
<p>
      <code>addProperty()</code> splits the provided key into its
      single parts and navigates through the properties tree along the
      corresponding element names. In this example it will start at the
      root element and then find the <code>tables</code> element. The
      next key part to be processed is <code>table</code>, but here a
      problem occurs: the configuration contains two <code>table</code>
      properties below the <code>tables</code> element. To get rid off
      this ambiguity an index can be specified at this position in the
      key that makes clear, which of the two properties should be
      followed. <code>tables.table(1).fields.field.name</code> e.g.
      would select the second <code>table</code> property. If an index
      is missing, <code>addProperty()</code> always follows the last
      available element. In our example this would be the second
      <code>table</code>, too.
    </p>
    
<p>
      The following parts of the key are processed in exactly the same
      manner. Under the selected <code>table</code> property there is
      exactly one <code>fields</code> property, so this step is not
      problematic at all. In the next step the <code>field</code> part
      has to be processed. At the actual position in the properties tree
      there are multiple <code>field</code> (sub) properties. So we here
      have the same situation as for the <code>table</code> part.
      Because no explicit index is defined the last <code>field</code>
      property is selected. The last part of the key passed to
      <code>addProperty()</code> (<code>name</code> in this example)
      will always be added as new property at the position that has
      been reached in the former processing steps. So in our example
      the last <code>field</code> property of the second table would
      be given a new <code>name</code> sub property and the resulting
      structure would look like the following listing:
    </p>
    
<div class="source">
<pre>	...
    &lt;table tableType="application"&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;documents&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;fields&gt;
        &lt;field&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;docid&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;type&gt;long&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;/field&gt;
        &lt;field&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;name&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;type&gt;java.lang.String&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;/field&gt;
        &lt;field&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;creationDate&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;type&gt;java.util.Date&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;/field&gt;
        &lt;field&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;authorID&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;type&gt;long&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;/field&gt;
        &lt;field&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;version&lt;/name&gt;
          &lt;name&gt;size&lt;/name&gt;    &lt;== Newly added property
          &lt;type&gt;int&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;/field&gt;
      &lt;/fields&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/tables&gt;
&lt;/database&gt;
</pre></div>
    
<p>
      This result is obviously not what was desired, but it demonstrates
      how <code>addProperty()</code> works: the method follows an
      existing branch in the properties tree and adds new leaves to it.
      (If the passed in key does not match a branch in the existing tree,
      a new branch will be added. E.g. if we pass the key
      <code>tables.table.data.first.test</code>, the existing tree can be
      navigated until the <code>data</code> part of the key. From here a
      new branch is started with the remaining parts <code>data</code>,
      <code>first</code> and <code>test</code>.)
    </p>
    
<p>
      If we want a different behavior, we must explicitly tell
      <code>addProperty()</code> what to do. In our example with the
      new field our intension was to create a new branch for the
      <code>field</code> part in the key, so that a new <code>field</code>
      property is added to the structure rather than adding sub properties
      to the last existing <code>field</code> property. This can be
      achieved by specifying the special index <code>(-1)</code> at the
      corresponding position in the key as shown below:
    </p>
    
<div class="source">
<pre>config.addProperty("tables.table(1).fields.field(-1).name", "size");
config.addProperty("tables.table(1).fields.field.type", "int");
</pre></div>
    
<p>
      The first line in this fragment specifies that a new branch is
      to be created for the <code>field</code> property (index -1).
      In the second line no index is specified for the field, so the
      last one is used - which happens to be the field that has just
      been created. So these two statements add a fully defined field
      to the second table. This is the default pattern for adding new
      properties or whole hierarchies of properties: first create a new
      branch in the properties tree and then populate its sub properties.
      As an additional example let's add a complete new table definition
      to our example configuration:
    </p>
    
<div class="source">
<pre>// Add a new table element and define the name
config.addProperty("tables.table(-1).name", "versions");

// Add a new field to the new table
// (an index for the table is not necessary because the latest is used)
config.addProperty("tables.table.fields.field(-1).name", "id");
config.addProperty("tables.table.fields.field.type", "int");

// Add another field to the new table
config.addProperty("tables.table.fields.field(-1).name", "date");
config.addProperty("tables.table.fields.field.type", "java.sql.Date");
...
</pre></div>
    
<p>
      For more information about adding properties to a hierarchical
      configuration also have a look at the javadocs for
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/HierarchicalConfiguration.html">

<h3><a name="Escaping_special_characters"></a>Escaping special characters</h3>
    
<p>
      Some characters in property keys or values require a special
      treatment.
    </p>
    
<p>
      Per default the dot character is used as delimiter by most
      configuration classes (we will learn how to change this for
      hierarchical configurations in a later section). In some
      configuration formats however, dots can be contained in the
      names of properties. For instance, in XML the dot is a legal
      character that can occur in any tag. The same is true for the names
      of properties in windows ini files. So the following XML
      document is completely valid:
    </p>
    
<div class="source">
<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?&gt;

&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;test.value&gt;42&lt;/test.value&gt;
  &lt;test.complex&gt;
    &lt;test.sub.element&gt;many dots&lt;/test.sub.element&gt;
  &lt;/test.complex&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre></div>
    
<p>
      This XML document can be loaded by <code>XMLConfiguration</code>
      without trouble, but when we want to access certain properties
      we face a problem: The configuration claims that it does not
      store any values for the properties with the keys
      <code>test.value</code> or <code>test.complex.test.sub.element</code>!
    </p>
    
<p>
      Of course, it is the dot character contained in the property
      names, which causes this problem. A dot is always interpreted
      as a delimiter between elements. So given the property key
      <code>test.value</code> the configuration would look for an
      element named <code>test</code> and then for a sub element
      with the name <code>value</code>. To change this behavior it is
      possible to escape a dot character, thus telling the configuration
      that it is really part of an element name. This is simply done
      by duplicating the dot. So the following statements will return
      the desired property values:
    </p>
   
<div class="source">
<pre>int testVal = config.getInt("test..value");
String complex = config.getString("test..complex.test..sub..element");
</pre></div>
    
<p>
      Note the duplicated dots wherever the dot does not act as
      delimiter. This way it is possible to access properties containing
      dots in arbitrary combination. However, as you can see, the
      escaping can be confusing sometimes. So if you have a choice,
      you should avoid dots in the tag names of your XML configuration
      files or other configuration sources.

<h3><a name="Internal_Representation"></a>Internal Representation</h3>
    
<p>
      You might have noted that the
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/HierarchicalConfiguration.html">
      HierarchicalConfiguration</a></code> interface has a type parameter
      defining the type of nodes it operates on. Internally, the nodes build up
      a tree structure on which queries or manipulating operations can be
      executed. There is an abstract base class
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/AbstractHierarchicalConfiguration.html">
      AbstractHierarchicalConfiguration</a></code> implementing a major part of
      the provided functionality in terms of abstract node objects. These nodes
      are not directly accessed, but via a so-called
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/tree/NodeHandler.html">
      NodeHandler</a></code>. The <code>NodeHandler</code> interface defines a
      number of methods for accessing properties of a node like its name, its
      value, or its children in a generic way.
    </p>
    
<p>
      This constellation makes it possible to integrate hierarchical configurations
      with different hierarchical data structures, e.g. file systems, JNDI, etc.
      The standard configurations shipped with <i>Commons Configuration</i>
      mainly use an in-memory representation of their data based on the
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/tree/ImmutableNode.html">
      ImmutableNode</a></code> class. There is a special base class for
      configurations of this type called
      <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/BaseHierarchicalConfiguration.html">
      BaseHierarchicalConfiguration</a></code>. As the name implies, the nodes
      used by these configurations are immutable; this is beneficial especially
      when it comes to <a href="howto_concurrency.html#Special_cases">concurrent
      access</a>. It is possible to obtain the root node of a
      <code>BaseHierarchicalConfiguration</code> object as shown in the
      following example, but this is necessary for very special use cases only
      because the most typical queries and manipulations can be done via the
      <code>HierarchicalConfiguration</code> interface.
    </p>

<h3><a name="Expression_engines"></a>Expression engines</h3>
        
<p>
            In the previous chapters we saw many examples about how properties
            in a <code>XMLConfiguration</code> object (or more general in a
            <code>HierarchicalConfiguration</code> object, because this is the
            base interface, which defines this functionality) can be queried or
            modified using a special syntax for the property keys. Well, this
            was not the full truth. Actually, property keys are not processed
            by the configuration object itself, but are delegated to a helper
            object, a so called <i>Expression engine</i>.
        </p>
        
<p>
            The separation of the task of interpreting property keys into a
            helper object is a typical application of the <i>Strategy</i>
            design pattern. In this case it also has the advantage that it
            becomes possible to plug in different expression engines into a
            <code>HierarchicalConfiguration</code> object. So by providing
            different implementations of the
            <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/tree/ExpressionEngine.html">
            ExpressionEngine</a></code>
            interface hierarchical configurations can support alternative
            expression languages for accessing their data.
        </p>
        
<p>
            Before we discuss the available expression engines that ship
            with Commons Configuration, it should be explained how an
            expression engine can be associated with a configuration object.
            <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/HierarchicalConfiguration.html">
            HierarchicalConfiguration</a></code> and all implementing classes
            provide a <code>setExpressionEngine()</code> method, which expects
            an implementation of the <code>ExpressionEngine</code> interface as
            argument. After this method was called, the configuration object will
            use the passed expression engine, which means that all property keys
            passed to methods like <code>getProperty()</code>,
            <code>getString()</code>, or <code>addProperty()</code> must
            conform to the syntax supported by this engine. Property keys
            returned by the <code>getKeys()</code> method will follow this
            syntax, too.
        </p>
        
<p>
            The recommended approach is that a configuration object is fully
            initialized by the <a href="howto_builders.html">configuration
            builder</a> which creates it. The initialization parameters for
            hierarchical configurations allow setting the expression engine as
            shown in the following code fragment (more information about
            initialization parameters for hierarchical and XML configurations
            is provided in a later section in this chapter):
        </p>

<div class="source">
<pre>Parameters params = new Parameters();
FileBasedConfigurationBuilder&lt;XMLConfiguration&gt; builder =
    new FileBasedConfigurationBuilder&lt;BaseHierarchicalConfiguration&gt;(BaseHierarchicalConfiguration.class)
    .configure(params.hierarchical()
        .setExpressionEngine(new MyExpressionEngine()));
</pre></div>
        
<p>
            Remember that it is possible to define
            <a href="howto_builders.html#Default_Initialization_Parameters">Default
            Initialization Parameters</a> for specific configuration classes.
            Using this mechanism, it is possible to instance to set a special
            expression engine for all XML configurations used by an
            application.
        </p>

        <a name="The_default_expression_engine"></a>
        <b>The default expression engine</b>
            
<p>
                The syntax described so far for property keys of hierarchical
                configurations is implemented by a specific implementation of the
                <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/tree/ExpressionEngine.html">
                ExpressionEngine</a></code> interface called
                <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/tree/DefaultExpressionEngine.html">
                DefaultExpressionEngine</a></code>. An instance of this class
                is used by the base implementation of
                <code>HierarchicalConfiguration</code> if no specific expression
                engine was set (which is the reason why our examples above worked).
            </p>
            
<p>
                After reading the examples of property keys provided so far in
                this document you should have a sound understanding regarding
                the features and the syntax supported by the
                <code>DefaultExpressionEngine</code> class. But it can do a
                little bit more for you: it defines a bunch of settings,
                which can be used to customize most tokens that can appear in a
                valid property key. You prefer curly brackets over paranthesis
                as index markers? You find the duplicated dot as escaped
                property delimiter counter-intuitive? Well, simply go ahead and
                change it! The following example shows how the syntax of a
                <code>DefaultExpressionEngine</code> object is modified. The
                key is to create an instance of the
                <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/tree/DefaultExpressionEngineSymbols.html">
                DefaultExpressionEngineSymbols</a></code> class and to
                initialize it with the desired syntax elements. This is done
                using a builder approach:
            </p>
            
<div class="source">
<pre>DefaultExpressionEngineSymbols symbols =
    new DefaultExpressionEngineSymbols.Builder(
        DefaultExpressionEngineSymbols.DEFAULT_SYMBOLS)
        // Use a slash as property delimiter
        .setPropertyDelimiter("/")
        // Indices should be specified in curly brackets
        .setIndexStart("{")
        .setIndexEnd("}")
        // For attributes use simply a @
        .setAttributeStart("@")
        .setAttributeEnd(null)
        // A Backslash is used for escaping property delimiters
        .setEscapedDelimiter("\\/")
        .create();
DefaultExpressionEngine engine = new DefaultExpressionEngine(symbols);

// Now create a configuration using this expression engine
Parameters params = new Parameters();
FileBasedConfigurationBuilder&lt;XMLConfiguration&gt; builder =
    new FileBasedConfigurationBuilder&lt;XMLConfiguration&gt;(XMLConfiguration.class)
    .configure(params.xml()
        .setFileName("tables.xml")
        .setExpressionEngine(engine));
XMLConfiguration config = builder.getConfiguration();

// Access properties using the new syntax
String tableName = config.getString("tables/table{0}/name");
String tableType = config.getString("tables/table{0}@type");
         </pre></div>
            
<p>
              <code>DefaultExpressionEngineSymbol</code> objects are
              immutable; the same is true for <code>DefaultExpressionEngine</code>.
              Thus a single expression engine instance can be shared between
              multiple configuration instances. The example fragment shows the
              typical usage pattern for constructing new
              <code>DefaultExpressionEngine</code> instances with an alternative
              syntax: A builder for a symbols object is constructed passing in
              an instance that serves as starting point - here the constant
              <code>DEFAULT_SYMBOLS</code> is used which defines the standard
              syntax. Then methods of the builder are used to modify only the
              settings which are to be adapted.
            </p>
            
<p>
                <i>Tip:</i> Sometimes when processing an XML document you
                don't want to distinguish between attributes and "normal"
                child nodes. You can achieve this by setting the
                <code>AttributeEnd</code> property to <b>null</b> and the
                <code>AttributeStart</code> property to the same value as the
                <code>PropertyDelimiter</code> property. Then the syntax for
                accessing attributes is the same as the syntax for other
                properties:
            </p>
            
<div class="source">
<pre>DefaultExpressionEngineSymbols symbolsNoAttributes =
    new DefaultExpressionEngineSymbols.Builder(
        DefaultExpressionEngineSymbols.DEFAULT_SYMBOLS)
        .setAttributeStart(
            DefaultExpressionEngineSymbols.DEFAULT_SYMBOLS.getPropertyDelimiter())
        .setAttributeEnd(null)
        .create();
DefaultExpressionEngine engine = new DefaultExpressionEngine(symbolsNoAttributes);
...
Object value = config.getProperty("tables.table(0).name");
// name can either be a child node of table or an attribute
         </pre></div>
            
<p>
              There is another property which can be used to customize an
              instance of <code>DefaultExpressionEngine</code>: the <i>node
              name matcher</i>. This is an object implementing the
              <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/tree/NodeMatcher.html">
              NodeMatcher</a></code> interface which controls how the names of
              configuration nodes are matched against the single parts of a
              configuration key. It can be passed as an optional second argument
              to the constructor. Per default, an exact match is performed, i.e.
              in order to successfully resolve a key like <i>tables.table.name</i>,
              there has to be a node named <i>tables</i> with a child node
              named <i>table</i> which in turn has a child with the name
              <i>name</i> - this is what most people would expect.

              There are use cases, however, when more flexibility or tolerance
              is desired. For instance, applications under Windows storing their
              settings in ini files sometimes expect that they can access keys
              in a case insensitive manner. The node name matcher can help
              here. The enumeration class
              <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/tree/NodeNameMatchers.html">
              NodeNameMatchers</a></code> defines some standard matchers which
              can collaborate with <code>DefaultExpressionEngine</code>. In
              addition to the <code>EQUALS</code> matcher used by default, there
              is also an <code>EQUALS_IGNORE_CASE</code> matcher. According to
              its name, this matcher ignores case when matching configuration
              keys against nodes. The following fragment shows how this matcher
              can be enabled (we use an <code>INIConfiguration</code> as
              example here, but this technique works with all other hierarchical
              configurations, too):
            </p>

        <b>The XPATH expression engine</b>
            
<p>
                The expression language provided by the <code>DefaultExpressionEngine</code>
                class is powerful enough to address all properties in a
                hierarchical configuration, but it is not always convenient to
                use. Especially if list structures are involved, it is often
                necessary to iterate through the whole list to find a certain
                element.
            </p>
            
<p>
                Think about our example configuration that stores information about
                database tables. A use case could be to load all fields that belong
                to the "users" table. If you knew the index of this
                table, you could simply build a property key like
                <code>tables.table(&lt;index&gt;).fields.field.name</code>,
                but how do you find out the correct index? When using the
                default expression engine, the only solution to this problem is
                to iterate over all tables until you find the "users"
                table.
            </p>
            
<p>
                Life would be much easier if an expression language could be used,
                which would directly support queries of such kind. In the XML
                world, the XPATH syntax has grown popular as a powerful means
                of querying structured data. In XPATH a query that selects all
                field names of the "users" table would look something
                like <code>tables/table[@name='users']/fields/name</code> (here
                we assume that the table's name is modelled as an attribute).
                This is not only much simpler than an iteration over all tables,
                but also much more readable: it is quite obvious, which fields
                are selected by this query.
            </p>
            
<p>
                Given the power of XPATH it is no wonder that we got many
                user requests to add XPATH support to <i>Commons Configuration</i>.
                Well, here is it!
            </p>
            
<p>
                For enabling XPATH syntax for property keys you need the
                <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/tree/xpath/XPathExpressionEngine.html">
                XPathExpressionEngine</a></code> class. This class
                implements the <code>ExpressionEngine</code> interface and can
                be plugged into a <code>HierarchicalConfiguration</code> object
                in the same way as described above. Because instances of
                <code>XPathExpressionEngine</code> are thread-safe and can be
                shared between multiple configuration objects it is also
                possible to set an instance as the default expression engine
                in the <a href="howto_builders.html#Default_Initialization_Parameters">
                default initialization parameters</a> for configuration
                builders, so that all hierarchical configuration
                objects make use of XPATH syntax. The following code fragment
                shows how XPATH support can be enabled for a configuration
                object:
            </p>
            
<div class="source">
<pre>Parameters params = new Parameters();
FileBasedConfigurationBuilder&lt;XMLConfiguration&gt; builder =
    new FileBasedConfigurationBuilder&lt;XMLConfiguration&gt;(XMLConfiguration.class)
    .configure(params.xml()
        .setFileName("tables.xml")
        .setExpressionEngine(new XPathExpressionEngine()));
XMLConfiguration config = builder.getConfiguration();

// Now we can use XPATH queries:
List&lt;Object&gt; fields = config.getList("tables/table[1]/fields/name");
         </pre></div>
            
<p>
                XPATH expressions are not only used for selecting properties
                (i.e. for the several getter methods), but also for adding new
                properties. For this purpose the keys passed into the
                <code>addProperty()</code> method must conform to a special
                syntax. They consist of two parts: the first part is an
                arbitrary XPATH expression that selects the node where the new
                property is to be added to, the second part defines the new
                element to be added. Both parts are separated by whitespace.
            </p>
            
<p>
                Okay, let's make an example. Say, we want to add a <code>type</code>
                property under the first table (as a sibling to the <code>name</code>
                element). Then the first part of our key will have to select
                the first table element, the second part will simply be
                <code>type</code>, i.e. the name of the new property:
            </p>
            
<div class="source">
<pre>config.addProperty("tables/table[1] type", "system");
         </pre></div>
            
<p>
                (Note that indices in XPATH are 1-based, while in the default
                expression language they are 0-based.) In this example the part
                <code>tables/table[1]</code> selects the target element of the
                add operation. This element must exist and must be unique, otherwise an exception
                will be thrown. <code>type</code> is the name of the new element
                that will be added. If instead of a normal element an attribute
                should be added, the example becomes
            </p>
            
<div class="source">
<pre>config.addProperty("tables/table[1] @type", "system");
         </pre></div>
            
<p>
                It is possible to add complete paths at once. Then the single
                elements in the new path are separated by "/"
                characters. The following example shows how data about a new
                table can be added to the configuration. Here we use full paths:
            </p>
            
<div class="source">
<pre>// Add new table "tasks" with name element and type attribute
config.addProperty("tables table/name", "tasks");
// last() selects the last element of this name,
// which is the newest table element
config.addProperty("tables/table[last()] @type", "system");

// Now add fields
config.addProperty("tables/table[last()] fields/field/name", "taskid");
config.addProperty("tables/table[last()]/fields/field[last()] type", "int");
config.addProperty("tables/table[last()]/fields field/name", "name");
config.addProperty("tables/table[last()]/fields field/name", "startDate");
...
         </pre></div>
            
<p>
                The first line of this example adds the path <code>table/name</code>
                to the <code>tables</code> element, i.e. a new <code>table</code>
                element will be created and added as last child to the
                <code>tables</code> element. Then a new <code>name</code> element
                is added as child to the new <code>table</code> element. To this
                element the value "tasks" is assigned. The next line
                adds a <code>type</code> attribute to the new table element. To
                obtain the correct <code>table</code> element, to which the
                attribute must be added, the XPATH function <code>last()</code>
                is used; this function selects the last element with a given
                name, which in this case is the new <code>table</code> element.
                The following lines all use the same approach to construct a new
                element hierarchy: At first complete new branches are added
                (<code>fields/field/name</code>), then to the newly created
                elements further children are added.
            </p>
            
<p>
                There is one gotcha with these keys described so far: they do
                not work with the <code>setProperty()</code> method! This is
                because <code>setProperty()</code> has to check whether the
                passed in key already exists; therefore it needs a key which can
                be interpreted by query methods. If you want to use
                <code>setProperty()</code>, you can pass in regular keys (i.e.
                without a whitespace separator). The method then tries to figure
                out which part of the key already exists in the configuration
                and adds new nodes as necessary. In principle such regular keys
                can also be used with <code>addProperty()</code>. However, they
                do not contain sufficient information to decide where new nodes
                should be added.
            </p>
            
<p>
                To make this clearer let's go back to the example with the
                tables. Consider that there is a configuration which already
                contains information about some database tables. In order to add
                a new table element in the configuration
                <code>addProperty()</code> could be used as follows:
            </p>
            
<div class="source">
<pre>config.addProperty("tables/table/name", "documents");
         </pre></div>
            
<p>
                In the configuration a <code>&lt;tables&gt;</code> element
                already exists, also <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> and
                <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> elements. How should the expression
                engine know where new node structures are to be added? The
                solution to this problem is to provide this information in the
                key by stating:
            </p>
            
<div class="source">
<pre>config.addProperty("tables table/name", "documents");
         </pre></div>
            
<p>
                Now it is clear that new nodes should be added as children of
                the  <code>&lt;tables&gt;</code> element. More information about
                keys and how they play together with <code>addProperty()</code>
                and <code>setProperty()</code> can be found in the Javadocs for
                <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/tree/xpath/XPathExpressionEngine.html">
                <code>XPathExpressionEngine</code></a>.

                <i>Note:</i> XPATH support is implemented through
