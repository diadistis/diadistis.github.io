<h2><a name="File-based_Configurations"></a>File-based Configurations</h2>
        
<p>
          Often configuration properties are stored in files on the user's hard
          disk, e.g. in .properties files or as XML documents. In order to
          access this data, functionality is needed to select the configuration
          files, load them into memory, and write changes back to disk. The
          following sections describe how this can be done.
        </p>

        <section>
<h3><a name="FileBasedConfigurationBuilder"></a>FileBasedConfigurationBuilder</h3>
        
<p>
          In <i>Commons Configuration</i> a specialized
          <a href="howto_builders.html#Configuration_Builders">configuration
          builder</a> implementation is responsible for the creation of
          file-based configuration objects and the management of their
          associated data files:
          <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/FileBasedConfigurationBuilder.html">
          FileBasedConfigurationBuilder</a></code>. Usage of this class follows
          the typical pattern for configuration builders, i.e. a builder
          instance is created providing the class of the <code>Configuration</code>
          object to be created, the <code>configure()</code> method is called
          with initialization parameters, and finally <code>getConfiguration()</code>
          returns an initialized instance of the configuration class. When
          configuring the builder the file to be loaded can be specified; if this
          was done, the <code>Configuration</code> object returned by the
          builder contains all properties read from the underlying file.
        </p>
        
<p>
          In order to define the file to be loaded, a parameters object
          implementing the
          <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/FileBasedBuilderProperties.html">
          FileBasedBuilderProperties</a></code> interface can be passed to the
          builder's <code>configure()</code> method. Using this interface the
          location of the file to be loaded can be provided in multiple ways:
          </p>
<ul>
            
<li>With the <code>setFile()</code> method the data file can be
            specified as a <code>java.io.File</code> object.</li>
            
<li>The <code>setURL()</code> method takes a <code>java.net.URL</code>
            as argument; the file will be loaded from this URL.</li>
            
<li>The methods <code>setFileName()</code> and <code>setBasePath()</code>
            allow specifying the path of the data file. The base path is
            important if relative paths are to be resolved based on this file.</li>
            
<li>With <code>setPath()</code> an absolute path to the file to be
            loaded can be provided.</li>
          </ul>
          A parameters object for file-based configurations is typically obtained
          from a <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/fluent/Parameters.html">
          Parameters</a></code> instance. Here the <code>fileBased()</code> method
          or one of the methods returning parameter objects derived from
          <code>FileBasedBuilderProperties</code> can be used. In addition to
          the properties that define the location of the file to be loaded, the
          parameters object support a couple of other properties, too, which
          are mainly related to way how the file is resolved. This is described
          later on in this chapter.
        
        
<p>
          As an example for using a file-based configuration builder, the
          following code fragment shows how a properties file can be read whose
          location is specified using a <code>File</code> object:
        </p>
        
<div class="source">
<pre>
Parameters params = new Parameters();
// Read data from this file
File propertiesFile = new File(&quot;config.properties&quot;);

FileBasedConfigurationBuilder&lt;FileBasedConfiguration&gt; builder =
    new FileBasedConfigurationBuilder&lt;FileBasedConfiguration&gt;(PropertiesConfiguration.class)
    .configure(params.fileBased()
        .setFile(propertiesFile));
try
{
    Configuration config = builder.getConfiguration();
    // config contains all properties read from the file
}
catch(ConfigurationException cex)
{
    // loading of the configuration file failed
}</pre></div>
        
<p>
          In this example a parameters object for file-based configurations
          is obtained from a <code>Parameters</code> instance. We could of
          course also have used a derived parameters class - when loading a
          properties file a parameters object for properties configurations
          would have been a logic choice. Here only a single parameter, the
          file to be loaded, is set; but remember that all other initialization
          parameters common to all configuration classes are available as well.
        </p>
	
<p>
	  A configuration instance created this way stays connected to its
	  builder. Especially, the builder stores the location of the
	  underlying configuration file. This comes in handy if changes on
	  the configuration object are to be written back to disk. For this
	  purpose, <code>FileBasedConfigurationBuilder</code> provides a
	  convenient <code>save()</code> method. Calling this method stores
	  the current content of the associated configuration into its original
	  configuration file, overwriting the existing file on disk. This is
	  demonstrated in the following code fragment which continues from the
	  previous example:
	</p>
        
<div class="source">
<pre>
// Some manipulations on the configuration object
config.addProperty(&quot;newProperty&quot;, &quot;new&quot;);
config.setProperty(&quot;updateProperty&quot;, &quot;changedValue&quot;);

// Make changes persistent
try
{
    builder.save();
}
catch(ConfigurationException cex)
{
    // saving of the configuration file failed
}</pre></div>
	
<p>
	  Note that the <code>save()</code> method of the builder does not
	  expect a configuration object as parameter. It always operates on
	  the instance managed by this builder. Because of this relationship
	  it is typically better to store the builder object rather than the
	  configuration. The configuration can always be obtained via the
	  builder's <code>getConfiguration()</code> method, but operations
	  related to the configuration file are only available through the
	  builder.
	</p>
	
<p>
	  In addition to the <code>save()</code> method,
	  <code>FileBasedConfigurationBuilder</code> offers functionality for
	  automatically saving changes on its managed configuration. This can
	  be used to ensure that every modification of a configuration object is
	  immediately written to disk. This feature is enabled via the
	  <code>setAutoSave()</code> method as shown in the following example:
	</p>
        
<div class="source">
<pre>
FileBasedConfigurationBuilder&lt;FileBasedConfiguration&gt; builder =
    new FileBasedConfigurationBuilder&lt;FileBasedConfiguration&gt;(PropertiesConfiguration.class)
    .configure(params.fileBased()
        .setFile(new File(&quot;config.properties&quot;)));
// enable auto save mode
builder.setAutoSave(true);

Configuration config = builder.getConfiguration();
config.setProperty(&quot;colors.background&quot;, &quot;#000000&quot;); // the configuration is saved after this call
</pre></div>
	
<p>
	  Be careful with this mode when you have many updates on your
          configuration. This will lead to many I/O operations, too. Behind
          the scenes, automatic saving is implemented via the
          <a href="howto_events.html">event notification mechanism</a> available
          for all configuration objects. A specialized event listener is
          registered at the builder's managed configuration object which triggers
          the <code>save()</code> method every time an update event is received.

<h3><a name="Making_it_easier"></a>Making it easier</h3>
        
<p>
          The code fragments presented so far in this chapter and the previous
          one show that the fluent API offered by configuration builders in many
          cases allows the creation and initialization of a configuration
          builder in a single expression. Nevertheless, especially in simple
          cases when no complex initialization is required, this approach tends
          to become verbose. For instance, if just a configuration is to be
          loaded from a file, you always have to create a file-based
          parameters object, initialize it, create a builder, and pass the
          parameters to its <code>configure()</code> method.
        </p>
        
<p>
          To support this frequent use case in a more convenient way, the
          <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/fluent/Configurations.html">
          Configurations</a></code> class exists. This class contains a bunch
          of convenience methods that simplify the creation of many standard
          configurations from different sources like files or URLs. Using
          this class, the code for the creation of a configuration builder can
          be reduced. The example for loading a properties configuration
          presented above becomes now:
        </p>
        
<div class="source">
<pre>
Configurations configs = new Configurations();
// Read data from this file
File propertiesFile = new File(&quot;config.properties&quot;);

FileBasedConfigurationBuilder&lt;PropertiesConfiguration&gt; builder =
    configs.propertiesBuilder(propertiesFile);
</pre></div>
        
<p>
          From this builder the properties configuration can be obtained in the
          usual way. It is even possible to by-pass the builder at all:
        </p>
        
<div class="source">
<pre>
Configurations configs = new Configurations();
// Read data from this file
File propertiesFile = new File(&quot;config.properties&quot;);

PropertiesConfiguration config = configs.properties(propertiesFile);
</pre></div>
        
<p>
          Here behind the scenes a configuration builder is created and
          initialized; then its managed configuration is queried and returned
          to the caller. A <code>ConfigurationException</code> is thrown if
          an error occurs. Skipping the configuration builder and accessing the
          configuration directly is recommended only for simple use cases. A
          builder typically offers more flexibility for the handling and
          management of configuration objects.
        </p>
        
<p>
          In these examples, a <code>java.io.File</code> object was used to
          access configuration data. There are overloaded methods for
          specifying the data to be loaded in alternative ways: using URLs or
          file names/paths. In addition to properties configurations, the
          <code>Configurations</code> class supports a couple of other
          frequently used configuration formats. For instance, the methods
          <code>xml()</code> and <code>xmlBuilder()</code> provide easy access
          to XML documents.
        </p>
        
<p>
          Even if there is no direct support for a specific configuration
          implementation, with the generic <code>fileBased()</code> or
          <code>fileBasedBuilder()</code> methods, access to all kinds of
          file-based configurations can be simplified. We take the
          <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/plist/PropertyListConfiguration.html">
          PropertyListConfiguration</a></code> class as an example for which no
          specific access methods exist. The code fragment below shows how a
          builder for such a configuration can be constructed using a generic
          method:
        </p>
        
<div class="source">
<pre>
Configurations configs = new Configurations();
// Read data from this URL
URL sourceURL = ...;

FileBasedConfigurationBuilder&lt;PropertyListConfiguration&gt; builder =
    configs.fileBasedBuilder(PropertyListConfiguration.class, sourceURL);
PropertyListConfiguration config = builder.getConfiguration();
</pre></div>
        
<p>
          <code>Configurations</code> instances are thread-safe and can be stored
          centrally by an application. So they can be used as a central configuration
          factory - of course, with limited flexibility; this is the price to
          be payed for simplicity. However, these restrictions can be partly
          circumvented by making use of
          <a href="howto_builders.html#Default_Initialization_Parameters">default
          initialization parameters</a>. An instance is associated with a
          <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/builder/fluent/Parameters.html">
          Parameters</a></code> object which is used to construct parameter
          objects for the created configuration builders. By assigning default
          parameters to this object the default settings used for the created
          builders can be tweaked. Note however, that the class typically
          creates only generic parameter objects; file-based parameters rather
          than, say, specialized parameters for properties configurations. This
          makes default settings only possible for basic parameters.
        </p>

<h3><a name="File_Operations_on_Configurations"></a>File Operations on Configurations</h3>
        
<p>
          With <code>FileBasedConfigurationBuilder</code> a single configuration
          file is assigned to a configuration instance. For some use cases a
          more flexible approach is required. For instance, a modified
          configuration is to be stored in another file, or multiple configuration
          files should be loaded into the same instance. To achieve this, the
          underlying mechanisms for dealing with files have to be used.
        </p>
        
<p>
          I/O operations on files are controlled by the
          <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/io/FileHandler.html">
          FileHandler</a></code> class. Basically, this class connects a location
          of a configuration file (and some other meta information like the
          file's encoding) with an object which can read data from or write data
          to this location. <code>FileHandler</code> defines the typical
          properties for defining the file to be loaded, i.e. the location can be
          specified as a URL, a File, an absolute path, etc.
        </p>
        
<p>
          The object which actually reads and writes the data is represented by the
          <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/io/FileBased.html">
          FileBased</a></code> interface. This is a pretty lean interface
          consisting of only two methods for reading data from a Reader and
          writing data to a Writer. All configuration implementations that can
          be initialized from configuration files implement this interface; but
          in theory the <code>FileHandler</code> could interact with other
          objects implementing <code>FileBased</code> as well.
        </p>
        
<p>
          <code>FileHandler</code> has the two methods <code>load()</code> and
          <code>save()</code>. They work as follows:
          </p>
<ul>
            
<li>The location of the managed file is evaluated, and a corresponding
            stream is opened. Depending on the way the location was specified,
            this could mean opening a connection on a URL, opening a stream to
            a <code>File</code> or an absolute path name, resolving relative
            file names, etc.</li>
            
<li>The resulting stream is then passed to the associated
            <code>FileBased</code>'s <code>read()</code> or <code>write()</code>
            method.</li>
          </ul>
        
        
<p>
          Next to these simple <code>load()</code> and <code>save()</code>
          methods a number of overloaded methods exists which expect additional
          parameters defining the source or target of the operation. For
          instance, there is a <code>load(URL)</code> method which reads data
          directly from the passed in URL ignoring the location stored in the
          <code>FileHandler</code> instance. In fact, there are overloaded
          methods for all the supported variants for defining a file. When
          making use of these methods the following points have to be kept in
          mind:
          </p>
<ul>
            
<li>The location stored in the <code>FileHandler</code> instance is
            not changed; it is completely by-passed by these methods. Only
            explicit calls to the various setter methods modify the location.</li>
            
<li>The <code>load()</code> methods eventually call the target
            object's <code>read()</code> method, no matter if it has already been
            called before. For configuration objects as target this means that
            the configuration is not cleared before new data is loaded.
            (Actually a <code>FileHandler</code> is not aware which kind of
            target object it is serving; so it has no chance to clear it first.)
            This behavior makes it easy to construct union configurations by
            simply executing multiple load operations. But if you want to reuse
            a configuration object and load a different file, remember to call the
            <code>clear()</code> method first to ensure that old properties are
            wiped out.</li>
          </ul>
        
        
<p>
          When constructing a <code>FileHandler</code> instance the
          <code>FileBased</code> object it operates on has to be passed to the
          constructor. With this information we are now able to look at a
          concrete example. The goal is to create a configuration for a
          properties file, read in another properties file (so that a union of
          the properties is constructed), and finally write the resulting
          configuration to a new file. The code can look as follows (the
          handling of exceptions has been omitted):
        </p>
        
<div class="source">
<pre>
// Read first file directly via the builder
FileBasedConfigurationBuilder&lt;PropertiesConfiguration&gt; builder =
    new FileBasedConfigurationBuilder&lt;PropertiesConfiguration&gt;(PropertiesConfiguration.class)
    .configure(params.fileBased()
        .setFile(new File(&quot;config.properties&quot;)));
PropertiesConfiguration config = builder.getConfiguration();

// Create a file handler and associate it with the configuration
FileHandler handler = new FileHandler(config);

// Load another configuration source, for instance from a relative path
handler.load(&quot;user.properties&quot;);

// Store the resulting configuration in a new file
File out = new File(&quot;union.properties&quot;);
handler.save(out);
</pre></div>
	
<p>
	  The <code>FileHandler</code> class is thread-safe; it is no problem
	  for instance to define a file location in one thread and then call
	  <code>load()</code> on another thread. It is also possible to have
	  multiple <code>FileHandler</code> objects associated with the same
	  target object. Here concurrent I/O operations could cause problems.
	  Therefore, <code>FileHandler</code> checks whether the target object
	  implements the
	  <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/sync/SynchronizerSupport.html">
          SynchronizerSupport</a></code> interface. If this is the case, proper
          synchronization for load and save operations can be performed. Because
          all configuration implementations implement <code>SynchronizerSupport</code>
          they can safely be used together with <code>FileHandler</code>.
	</p>
        
<p>
          Another important class related to file access is
          <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/io/FileLocator.html">
          FileLocator</a></code>. An instance stores all information
          required for resolving a file to be accessed. <code>FileHandler</code>
          uses a <code>FileLocator</code> instance to maintain this part of
          file-related information. If you need to customize the access to
          configuration files, you sometimes have to deal with
          <code>FileLocator</code> objects because the files to be operated on are
          described in terms of such objects.
        </p>

<h3><a name="Customizing_File_Access"></a>Customizing File Access</h3>
        
<p>
          When working with file-based configurations application code has multiple
          ways to specify the location of the file to be loaded. If a URL
          is provided, the source file to be loaded is defined in a pretty
          unambiguous way. If relative file names or paths are used, situation
          is less obvious.
        </p>
        
<p>
          <i>Commons Configuration</i> provides two mechanisms to customize the
          way configuration files are accessed:
          </p>
<ul>
            
<li>File systems</li>
            
<li>File location strategies</li>
          </ul>
          They are described in the following sub sections.
        
        </section>

      <section>
<h3><a name="File_Systems"></a>File Systems</h3>
      
<p>
        In its default mode of operation <i>Commons Configuration</i> supports retrieving and storing
        configuration files either on a local file system or via http. However, <i>Commons
        Configuration</i> provides support for allowing other File System adapters. All file
        access is accomplished through the <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/io/FileSystem.html">
        FileSystem</a></code> class so accessing files using other mechanisms is possible.
      </p>
      
<p>
        <i>Commons Configuration</i> also provides a second <code>FileSystem</code> implementation which allows retrieval using
        <a class="externalLink" href="https://commons.apache.org/vfs">Apache Commons VFS</a>. As of this writing
        Commons VFS supports 18 protocols for manipulating files.
      </p>
      
<p>
        The <code>FileSystem</code> used by <i>Commons Configuration</i> can be set in
        the builder's parameter object, together with other properties defining
        the file to be loaded. When working with
        <a href="howto_combinedconfiguration.html">CombinedConfigurationBuilder</a>
        it is also possible to
        define the file system in the configuration definition file to be
        processed by the builder - in both a global way and for each referenced
        sub configuration. The following listing shows a configuration definition
        file for a combined builder making use of this functionality. Per
        default, the <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/io/VFSFileSystem.html">
        VFSFileSystem</a></code> is used, but the included XML
        configuration is loaded via a
        <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/io/DefaultFileSystem.html">
        DefaultFileSystem</a></code> instance:
      </p>
     
<div class="source">
<pre>
&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;header&gt;
    &lt;fileSystem config-class=&quot;org.apache.commons.configuration2.io.VFSFileSystem&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;
  &lt;override&gt;
    &lt;xml fileName=&quot;settings.xml&quot; config-name=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
      &lt;fileSystem config-class=&quot;org.apache.commons.configuration2.io.DefaultFileSystem&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/xml&gt;

    &lt;!-- Other sources omitted --&gt;
  &lt;/override&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre></div>
      
<p>
        Commons VFS allows options to the underlying file systems being used. <i>Commons Configuration</i>
        allows applications to provide these by implementing the
        <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/io/FileOptionsProvider.html">
        FileOptionsProvider</a></code> interface
        and registering the provider with the <code>FileSystem</code>. <code>FileOptionsProvider</code>
        has a single method that must be implemented, <code>getOptions()</code>, which returns a Map
        containing the keys and values that the <code>FileSystem</code> might use. The <code>getOptions()</code>
        method is called as each configuration uses VFS to create a <code>FileOjbect</code> to
        access the file. The map returned does not have to contain the same keys and/or values
        each time it is called. For example, the value of the <code>currentUser</code> key can be
        set to the id of the currently logged in user to allow a WebDAV save to record the userid
        as a file attribute.
      </p>
      </section>

      <section>
<h3><a name="File_Location_Strategies"></a>File Location Strategies</h3>
      
<p>
        Before a file can be accessed it has to be located first. In the 1.x
        versions of <i>Commons Configuration</i>, there was a hard-coded
        algorithm for looking up configuration files defined by a file name
        and an optional base path in various places. Starting with version 2.0,
        it is now possible to adapt this algorithm. The key to this is the
        <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/io/FileLocationStrategy.html">
        FileLocationStrategy</a></code> interface. The interface defines
        a single method:
      </p>
     
<div class="source">
<pre>
URL locate(FileSystem fileSystem, FileLocator locator);
</pre></div>
      
<p>
        The purpose of this method is to resolve a file described by the passed
        in <code><a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration2/io/FileLocator.html">
        FileLocator</a></code> object and return a URL for it. If
        required, the provided <code>FileSystem</code> can be used. The URL
        yielded by a successful locate operation is directly used to access
        the affected file. If the file could not be resolved, a
        <code>FileLocationStrategy</code> implementation should not throw an
        exception, but return <b>null</b> instead. This allows multiple
        strategies to be chained so that different locations can be searched for
        the file one after the other.
      </p>
      
<p>
        <i>Commons Configuration</i> ships with a set of standard
        <code>FileLocationStrategy</code> implementations. They are pretty
        specialized, meaning that a single implementation focuses on a very
        specific search algorithm. The true power lies in combining these
        strategies in a way suitable for an application or use case. The
        following table describes the available <code>FileLocationStrategy</code>
        implementations:
      </p>
      
<p>
        </p>
<table border="0" class="bodyTable">
          
<tr class="a">

              Directly returns the URL stored in the passed in
              <code>FileLocator</code>. Unless an application needs some
              special URL transformation, a file locator's URL - if defined -
              can typically be used directly to access a file. So it makes
              sense to use this strategy at the very beginning of your chain
              of strategies.

              This is a kind of meta strategy which allows combining an arbitrary
              number of other <code>FileLocationStrategy</code> objects. At
              construction time a collection with sub strategies has to be
              passed in. In its implementation of the <code>locate()</code>
              method, the strategy iterates over all its sub strategies (in the
              order they were passed to the constructor) until one returns a
              non <b>null</b> URL. This URL is returned.

<p>
        As an example, consider that an application wants configuration files
        to be looked up (in this order)
        </p>
<ul>
          
<li>by their URL</li>
          
<li>by the file system (which will evaluate base path and file name)</li>
          
<li>on the classpath</li>
        </ul>
        Then a concrete location strategy could be constructed as follows:
      
     
<div class="source">
<pre>
List&lt;FileLocationStrategy&gt; subs = Arrays.asList(
  new ProvidedURLLocationStrategy(),
  new FileSystemLocationStrategy(),
  new ClasspathLocationStrategy());
FileLocationStrategy strategy = new CombinedLocationStrategy(subs);
</pre></div>
      
<p>
        This strategy can now be passed to a file-based configuration builder.
        If no strategy is passed to a builder, a default one is used. This
        default strategy is almost identical to the hard-coded search algorithm
        that was used in earlier versions of <i>Commons Configuration</i>.
        In fact, the pre-defined basic <code>FileLocationStrategy</code>
        implementations were extracted from this algorithm.
      </p>
      
<p>
        Because the <code>FileLocationStrategy</code> interface is very simple
        it should be easy to create a custom implementation. The specific
        search algorithm just has to be coded into the <code>locate()</code>
        method. Then this custom strategy implementation can be combined with
        other standard strategies by making use of a
        <code>CombinedLocationStrategy</code>.
